# Drag_and_Drop
1. Implement a drag and drop functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 2. Create two containers (e.g., div elements) side by side on the page. 3. Populate the first container with a list of items (e.g., images, text, or icons). 4. Allow users to drag and drop items from the first container to the second container.
